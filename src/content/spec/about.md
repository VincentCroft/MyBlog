## ✨ My favorite repos

I explore the synergy of hardware acceleration and edge intelligence for modern infrastructure. My work spans from FPGA-accelerated signal processing for real-time audio synthesis to edge-based fault detection in power grids using PMU data. I am drawn to projects that sit at the hardware–software interface—whether designing low-latency pipelines for creative applications or deploying lightweight ML models for anomaly detection in distributed energy systems. My goal is to architect efficient, real-time systems that are both experimentally validated and architecturally scalable.
